<h1>International education community gathers to deliberate on the development of AI competencies for all</h1>
<h3>December 17, 2020</h3>


<p>It is the core aim of the Forum to define human AI competencies - the knowledge, skills and values needed for effective human–machine collaboration in life, learning and work. Dedicating this Forum to the theme of Developing AI Competencies, we call on Member States to recognize the increasing importance of developing AI literacy and AI competencies for all citizens,” said UNESCO Assistant Director-General for Education Stefania Giannini during the Opening Ceremony of the International Forum on AI and the Futures of Education.</p>

<p>The International Forum was convened from 7 to 8 December 2020 to address the challenges associated with developing competencies for the AI era. The Forum, under the theme of Developing Competencies for the AI Era, merged virtual sessions and physical meetings to engage in debates on the implications of the pervasion of AI in the futures of education. It marked the first successful test of UNESCO in organizing a large-scale conference that merged both online sessions and physical meetings in the host country.</p>

<p>Organized in partnership with the Ministry of Education and the National Commission of the People’s Republic of China for UNESCO, the Forum provided a platform to exchange views on the definition of competencies required in the AI era, and competencies all people need to live and work effectively with AI. More than 80 speakers presented their AI experiences and initiatives to more than 3,000 attendees during the two-day event. It was opened by the Chinese Minister of Education, UNESCO’s Assistant Director-General for Education and Chairperson of the Executive Board of UNESCO. UNESCO’s intersectoral contribution to the event was further reinforced by representatives from its Social and Human Sciences Sector, Priority Africa and External Relations Sector, International Bureau of Education (IBE), and Institute for Information Technologies in Education.</p>           

<p>The high-level panels of the Forum invited Ministers, Vice-Ministers, or designated representatives of China, Slovenia, United Arab Emirates, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Croatia, Morocco, Qatar, Cambodia, and Kenya to share their national experiences and programmes on AI and education. Mr CHEN Baosheng, Minister of Education of China, called upon the international community to leverage the potential of AI in achieving four strategic objectives under the framework of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 to accelerate: the improvement of the quality of education; the achievement of a more equitable and more inclusive education; the provision of personalized learning that are relevant to different contexts and needs of all learners; the building of more open and flexible education systems.</p>
